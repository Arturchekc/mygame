            <p>**Labyrinth With Nazar is a thrilling game of tension, stealth, and survival. You'll need to rely on your awareness, logic, and speed to avoid being caught by Nazar - a mysterious pursuer who never stops chasing.

You find yourself trapped in a dark maze where every sound, every step, could be your last. All you have is a flashlight and your wits. Can you find the exit before Nazar finds you?

This game builds suspense from the very beginning and keeps you on edge with every move. Thereâ€™s no shooting - just silence, footsteps in the dark, and the fight to stay alive. If you think you're ready, try to escape. But remember: Nazar is always close...**</p>
