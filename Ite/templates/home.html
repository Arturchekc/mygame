            <p>**Labyrinth With Nazar is a thrilling game of tension, stealth, and survival. You'll need to rely on your awareness, logic, and speed to avoid being caught by Nazar - a mysterious pursuer who never stops chasing.

You find yourself trapped in a dark maze where every sound, every step, could be your last. All you have is a flashlight and your wits. Can you find the exit before Nazar finds you?

This game builds suspense from the very beginning and keeps you on edge with every move. There’s no shooting - just silence, footsteps in the dark, and the fight to stay alive. If you think you're ready, try to escape. But remember: Nazar is always close...**</p>
